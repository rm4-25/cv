[The Cuban Theater Digital Archive](http://ctda.library.miami.edu/)

The Cuban Theater Digital Archive (CTDA)is a resource for research, teaching and learning in Cuban theater and performance as well as in related fields; a community repository for improtant Cuban theatrical materials; and a forum to foster scholarly communication in this field. Over the summer of 2025, I was awarded a University of Miami graduate fellowship to work as an Assistant Editor to CTDA under the direction of Dr. Lillian Manzor.

This is a Digital Environmental Humanities project created by University of Miami doctoral students 
in the department of Modern Languages and Literature and English & Creative Writing over the Spring 2025 semester. The
project's guiding research question asks "How do our forms of connection to the environment reflect our relationship with it?"
We created a Leaflet Story Map as an attempt to answer this question through sounds captured throughout South Florida.
